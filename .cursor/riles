## Cursor Riles Configuration

### Command Triggers

- "build it": Execute the Build Instructions section below
- "debug": Execute the Debugging Instructions section below

### Build Instructions

1. Check todo.md for the next task to implement
2. Pick a todo item based on logical development order
3. Mark the next logical todo item with "<--Next" in todo.md
4. Follow requirements in docs/specifications.md
5. Adhere to coding standards in docs/coding_standards.md
6. Record all code changes in CHANGELOG.md
7. Keep code simple and maximize module reuse
8. Write tests for each module
9. Update todo.md to track progress
10. Notify the user of completed work, tests to run, and code to review

### Debugging Instructions

When elements don't exist during debugging:

1. Check the codebase to see if they exist elsewhere
2. Prompt the user for code access if needed
3. If elements don't exist, create barebones versions that can be enhanced later
4. Don't unnecessarily modify already implemented and tested code
5. Update todo.md to note that barebones implementations have been started
