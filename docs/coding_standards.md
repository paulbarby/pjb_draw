# Coding and Testing Standards for Python-Based Drawing Package

## 1. General Coding Standards

### 1.1 Code Structure

- Follow **PEP 8** coding style.
- Maintain **consistent indentation** (4 spaces per indentation level).
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**.
- Keep functions and methods **short and focused** (preferably under 30 lines).
- **Avoid code duplication** by refactoring common logic into reusable functions or classes.
- Use **docstrings** for all modules, classes, and public functions.

### 1.2 Python Version and Dependencies

- The project must use **Python 3.10+**.
- All dependencies should be listed in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.
- Use **virtual environments** (venv, poetry, or conda) for dependency isolation.

### 1.3 Object-Oriented Design

- Use **class-based architecture** where appropriate.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit direct access to object attributes where necessary.
- **Inheritance and Composition:** Use when appropriate for modularity and reusability.

### 1.4 Code Comments & Documentation

- Use **docstrings** for modules, classes, and functions.
- Use inline comments sparingly to clarify complex logic.
- Maintain an updated **README.md** with installation and usage instructions.

### 1.5 Error Handling

- Handle exceptions gracefully using `try-except` blocks.
- Avoid generic `except` clauses; catch specific exceptions.
- Log errors using **Python's logging module** instead of printing to the console.

## 2. Testing Standards

### 2.1 Testing Framework

- Use **pytest** as the primary testing framework.
- All tests should reside in the `tests/` directory.
- Tests should be modular and independent of each other.
- Aim for at least **80% test coverage**.

### 2.2 Types of Tests

#### 2.2.1 Unit Tests

- Every module, function, and class should have unit tests.
- Test cases should cover **normal, boundary, and edge cases**.
- Use **mocking** where necessary to isolate functionality.

#### 2.2.2 Integration Tests

- Ensure that multiple components interact as expected.
- Test database and API interactions if applicable.

#### 2.2.3 UI Tests

- Use **PyQt/PySide or Tkinter test frameworks** if applicable.
- Automate tests for key UI workflows.
- Ensure UI is responsive and resizes correctly.

### 2.3 Continuous Integration (CI)

- Use **GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins** to automate testing.
- Ensure tests are automatically run on every commit and pull request.
- Tests should be run on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### 2.4 Code Coverage

- Use **pytest-cov** to measure code coverage.
- Aim for **80%+ coverage**, focusing on critical components.
- Generate coverage reports and address untested code paths.

### 2.5 Performance Testing

- Profile performance-critical functions using **cProfile** or **timeit**.
- Optimize any bottlenecks affecting rendering and interactivity.

## 3. Version Control & Code Review

### 3.1 Git Standards

- Use **Git for version control**.
- Follow **Git branching strategy** (e.g., `main`, `dev`, `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`).
- Commit messages should be **clear and descriptive** (e.g., "Fix bug in arrow rendering").

### 3.2 Code Review Process

- All code changes must go through a **pull request (PR)**.
- At least one reviewer must approve a PR before merging.
- PRs should include descriptions and references to relevant issues.

---

## 4. Security Best Practices

- Sanitize all user inputs where applicable.
- Do not store sensitive information in code.
- Use **secure file handling** when loading and saving images.
- Ensure **safe serialization** of user-generated data.

---

## 5. Deployment & Release Management

- Use **semantic versioning** (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
- Maintain a **CHANGELOG** for all updates.
- Releases should be tested on all target platforms before deployment.
- Automate deployment using **CI/CD pipelines** where possible.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Following these coding and testing standards will ensure the Python-based drawing package is maintainable, efficient, and robust. Regular reviews and updates should be conducted to refine best practices as the project evolves.
